\section{Purpose}

The goal of the experiment was to determine the specific heat capacities of various substances based on measurements of mass, temperature, power, and/or time.
For parts 1 and 2 the material was known, so the calculated specific heat capacities could be compared to the accepted values.
For part 3 the material was unknown, so its identity was guessed based on the calculated specific heat capacity.
