%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Purpose %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Purpose}

For part 1, the goal was to examine how material, cross-sectional area, and length impact resistance.
For each coil of wire, resistance was determined in three ways: based on measurements of voltage and current, based on the resistance readings from the multimeter, and based on the dimensions of the wires and the resistivity of the materials.
The results of the three methods of determining resistance were compared.

For part 2, the goal was to examine voltage, current, and resistance for two resistors in series and two resistors in parallel.
For each nichrome resistor, resistance was determined in two ways: based on measurements of voltage and current, and based on the resistance readings from the multimeter.
The results of these two methods were compared.
The readings from the multimeter were accepted as the true resistance values, which were then used to calculated the theoretical resistance of the resistors in series and the resistors in parallel.
These theoretical resistances were compared to experimental values found by setting up the circuits and measuring voltage and current.
In addition, measurements of voltage and current were made at different parts of the series and parallel circuits in order to see if the matched what theory predicts.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Results %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

Table \ref{tab:resistance_coils} contains the properties of the resistance coils used in part 1.
$\rho$ is the resistivity of the material.
$L$ is the length of the coil of wire.
$D$ is the diameter of the wire.
The values for $\rho$, $L$, and $D$ were assumed to be exact, without uncertainty.
In addition, note that Nickel-Silver is a copper alloy consisting of copper, nickel, and zinc or manganese.
The exact composition of the alloy used in the experiment is unknown.
Thus, the resistivity was approximated to be $\sci{44}{-8} \units{\Omega~m}$, the value for Manganin (Cu 84\%, Mn 12\%, Ni 4\%), an alloy of similar composition.

Figure \ref{fig:resistance_vs_length} plots resistance ($R_{V/I}$, $R_\mathrm{m}$, and $R_\mathrm{th}$) versus length ($L$) for the first five resistance coils used in part 1.
Those coils were chosen for the graph as they all had the same material and diameter.
Since the graphs seemed linear (and that's what theory predicts) a linear fit was applied.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Uncertainty %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Uncertainty}

All the voltage, current, and resistance measurements in the experiment were made using a multimeter.
If there were fluctuations in a particular reading with the multimeter (voltage, current, or resistance), then the uncertainty was taken to be the magnitude of the fluctuations, as that gives an upper bound for how much the value could have varied.
If the reading with the multimeter (voltage, current, or resistance) was stable and did not fluctuate, then the uncertainty was taken to be the smallest increment of measure, since that was the limiting precision of the equipment.

In parts 1 and 2, $R_{V/I}$ was calculated using equation \ref{eq:r_from_vi}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  R_{V/I} & = & \frac{V}{I} \label{eq:r_from_vi}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The uncertainty of $R_{V/I}$ is given by equation \ref{eq:r_from_vi_uncertainty}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \Delta R_{V/I} & = & \left[
    \left(\frac{\partial R_{V/I}}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2
    + \left(\frac{\partial R_{V/I}}{\partial I} \Delta I \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \label{eq:r_from_vi_uncertainty} \\
  & = & \frac{V}{I} \left[
    \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2
    + \left( \frac{\Delta I}{I} \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

In part 1, $R_\mathrm{m}$ was calculated using equation \ref{eq:r_from_m}.
Note that the combined value ($R_\mathrm{m} + r$) was measured, as was the value for $r$.
But $R_\mathrm{m}$ was not measured, hence why it is being calculated as a difference of two values.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  R_\mathrm{m} & = & (R_\mathrm{m} + r) - r \label{eq:r_from_m}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The uncertainty of $R_\mathrm{m}$ is given by equation \ref{eq:r_from_m_uncertainty}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \Delta R_\mathrm{m} & = & \left[
    \left(\frac{\partial R_\mathrm{m}}{\partial (R_\mathrm{m} + r)} \Delta (R_\mathrm{m} + r) \right)^2
    + \left(\frac{\partial R_\mathrm{m}}{\partial r} \Delta r \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \label{eq:r_from_m_uncertainty} \\
  & = & \left[
    \left( \Delta (R_\mathrm{m} + r) \right)^2
    + \left( \Delta r \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

Similarly in part 2, the true resistance values $R_1$ and $R_2$, referred to as just $R$, were calculated using equation \ref{eq:r_true_from_m}.
Note that the combined value ($R + r$) was measured, as was the value for $r$.
But $R$ was not measured, hence why it is being calculated as a difference of two values.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  R & = & (R + r) - r \label{eq:r_true_from_m}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The uncertainty of $R$ is given by equation \ref{eq:r_true_from_m_uncertainty}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \Delta R & = & \left[
    \left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial (R + r)} \Delta (R + r) \right)^2
    + \left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial r} \Delta r \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \label{eq:r_true_from_m_uncertainty} \\
  & = & \left[
    \left( \Delta (R + r) \right)^2
    + \left( \Delta r \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

In part 1, $R_\mathrm{th}$ was calculated using equation \ref{eq:r_th}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  R_\mathrm{th} & = & \frac{\rho L}{A} \label{eq:r_th} \\
  & = & \frac{\rho L}{\pi (D/2)^2} \nonumber \\
  & = & \frac{4 \rho L}{\pi D^2} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
Note that the values for $\rho$, $L$, and $D$ were assumed to be exact, without uncertainty.
Thus, $R_\mathrm{th}$ would have no uncertainty as well.

In part 2, $R_{1+2}$, the theoretical resistance for the two resistors in series, was calculated using equation \ref{eq:r_1_2_series}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  R_{1+2} & = & R_1 + R_2 \label{eq:r_1_2_series}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The uncertainty of $R_{1+2}$ is given by equation \ref{eq:r_1_2_series_uncertainty}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \Delta R_{1+2} & = & \left[
    \left(\frac{\partial R_{1+2}}{\partial R_1} \Delta R_1 \right)^2
    + \left(\frac{\partial R_{1+2}}{\partial R_2} \Delta R_2 \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \label{eq:r_1_2_series_uncertainty} \\
  & = & \left[
    \left( \Delta R_1 \right)^2
    + \left( \Delta R_2 \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

In part 2, $R_{1||2}$, the theoretical resistance for the two resistors in parallel, was calculated using equation \ref{eq:r_1_2_parallel}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  R_{1||2} & = & \left( R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1} \right)^{-1} \label{eq:r_1_2_parallel}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The uncertainty of $R_{1||2}$ is given by equation \ref{eq:r_1_2_parallel_uncertainty}.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \Delta R_{1||2} & = & \left[
    \left(\frac{\partial R_{1||2}}{\partial R_1} \Delta R_1 \right)^2
    + \left(\frac{\partial R_{1||2}}{\partial R_2} \Delta R_2 \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \label{eq:r_1_2_parallel_uncertainty} \\
  & = & \left[
    \left( \left[ R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1} \right]^{-2} \frac{\Delta R_1}{R_1^2} \right)^2
    + \left( \left[ R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1} \right]^{-2} \frac{\Delta R_2}{R_2^2} \right)^2
  \right]^\frac{1}{2} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

In part 1, the resistances of 7 different resistance coils were determined using three different techniques.
Descriptions of the coils are in table \ref{tab:resistance_coils}, and the calculated resistance values are in table \ref{tab:resistances_part_1}.
The experimental resistances $R_{V/I}$ and $R_\mathrm{m}$ had similar values for all the coils.
Coils 1, 4, and 5 had resistance values that overlapped within uncertainty, while the rest of the coils (2, 3, 6, and 7) had values that were still fairly close and almost within uncertainty.
While the experimental resistances were similar, their values were all higher than the corresponding theoretical resistances $R_\mathrm{th}$.
One possible explanation is that when measuring voltage and resistance, the multimeter was connected to the resistance coils through a small bit of copper wire.
This copper wire section was not included when measuring $r$, but it was included when measuring $(R_\mathrm{m} + r)$.
As a result, this would cause $R_\mathrm{m}$ to be higher than expected.
This extra resistance would also have increased the measured value for $V$, thereby causing $R_{V/I}$ to be higher than expected.
Another possibility is that the temperature of the room did not match the reference temperature of 20 ℃.
The table the resistivity values were taken from used a reference temperature of 20 ℃.
If the room were warmer than 20 ℃, then the actual resistivity values would have been slightly higher than the $\rho$ values used for calculations.
This would cause $R_\mathrm{th}$ to be lower than expected.

Resistance coils 1 through 5 were all made of the same material and had the same cross-sectional area, but they had different lengths.
Figure \ref{fig:resistance_vs_length} plots resistance ($R_{V/I}$, $R_\mathrm{m}$, and $R_\mathrm{th}$) versus length ($L$).
The graphs are linear with y-intercepts close to zero.
Thus, the data indicates that the resistance of a wire/coil is proportional to its length.

Resistance coils 5 and 6 were made of the same material and had the same length, but they had different cross-sectional areas.
The experimental resistances for coil 5 ($R_{V/I} = 20.21 \pm 0.03 \units{\Omega}$, $R_\mathrm{m} = 20.2 \pm 0.1 \units{\Omega}$) were higher than the experimental resistances for coil 6 ($R_{V/I} = 11.84 \pm 0.02 \units{\Omega}$, $R_\mathrm{m} = 11.6 \pm 0.1 \units{\Omega}$).
The cross-sectional area of coil 5 ($A = \frac{1}{4} \pi (0.0254 \units{cm})^2 = \sci{5.07}{-4} \units{cm^2}$) was lower than the cross-sectional area of coil 6 ($A = \frac{1}{4} \pi (0.0320 \units{cm})^2 = \sci{8.04}{-4} \units{cm^2}$).
Thus, the data suggests that as cross-sectional area increases, resistances decreases.

Resistance coil 7, made out of copper, was 10 times longer than coil 5, made out of nickel-silver, with the same cross-sectional area. 
Since it has already been shown that resistance is proportional to length, then dividing the experimental resistance values for coil 7 by 10 would allow us to compare the resistances of two wires of identical dimensions but different materials.
Thus, our hypothetical $200 \units{cm}$ long copper resistance coil of diameter $0.0254 \units{cm}$ would have experimental resistances $R_{V/I} = 0.696 \pm 0.002 \units{\Omega}$ and $R_\mathrm{m} = 0.72 \pm 0.01 \units{\Omega}$.
For comparison, coil 5 had experimental resistances $R_{V/I} = 20.21 \pm 0.03 \units{\Omega}$ and $R_\mathrm{m} = 20.2 \pm 0.1 \units{\Omega}$.
The resistance of coil 5 was much higher than the resistance of the hypothetical copper wire with identical length and diameter.
This supports the idea that resistance depends on material, with some materials having more resistance for a given wire shape than others.

In part 2, the resistance of two nichrome coils were measured, and those measurements were used to determine the resistance of four different circuits.
The true values of both coils' resistances are in table \ref{tab:true_resistances_part_2}, the experimental values of the first coil are in table \ref{tab:R_1_experimental_values}, and the experimental values of the second coil are in table \ref{tab:R_2_experimental_values}.
For both coils, the experimental resistances $R_{V/I}$ were within uncertainty of each other, but were not within uncertainty of their respective coil's true resistance.
However, the experimental resistances were fairly close to the true values, with a difference of around $0.3 \units{\Omega}$ for $R_1$ and $0.2 \units{\Omega}$ for $R_2$.
(Did we have extra or less wires when measuring these experimental values? May explain why values didn't match up).
After measuring the resistance of the first two circuits containing only one of the nichrome coils at a time, both coils were connected in series, then in parallel.
The theoretical resistances of these two circuits are in table \ref{tab:theoretical_resistances_part_2}, the experimental equivalent resistance values of the series circuit are in table \ref{tab:series_experimental_values}, and the experimental equivalent resistance values of the parallel circuit are in table \ref{tab:parallel_experimental_values}.
Similar to the first two circuits, the experimental resistances $R_{V/I}$ of the series circuit were all within uncertainty of each other, while the experimental resistances $R_{V/I}$ of the parallel circuit were not all within uncertainty of each other, although they were very close.
The experimental resistances of the series circuit were within uncertainty of the theoretical resistance $R_{1+2}$, while the experimental resistances of the parallel circuit did not fall within uncertainty of the theoretical resistance $R_{1||2}$, although they were fairly close, being around $0.03 \units{\Omega}$ less than the theoretical resistance.
