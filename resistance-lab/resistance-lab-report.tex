%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Purpose %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Purpose}

For part 1, the goal was to examine how material, cross-sectional area, and length impact resistance.
For each coil of wire, resistance was determined in three ways: based on measurements of voltage and current; based on the resistance reading from the multimeter; and based on the dimensions of the wires and the resistivity of the material.
In addition, the results of the three methods of determining resistance were compared.
