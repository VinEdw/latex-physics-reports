%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Purpose %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Purpose}

The goal of the exercise was to use Kirchhoff's rules to analyze 7 different circuits and calculate current, voltage, and power through each circuit element.
For the first 4 circuits, the voltage and current calculations were compared to results obtained using an online circuit simulator.
