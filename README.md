# LaTeX Physics Reports

I am trying to learn how to use LaTeX to make physics lab reports.
I am using the [IOPScience Template](https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/questions/latex-template/) as the document class.
The `.zip` file linked there was extracted into a new folder at `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX\tex\latex\iopart` in order to make it available for use by LaTeX on my laptop.
